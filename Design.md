# The Alien
## Game Design Document

### Intended For:
People who like both puzzles and linguistics. And are willing to think for a while.

### Plot:
You meet an alien. You need something from him, and he seems to need something from you. His language contains like 20 words, none of which you understand. (Each word should be a single letter, I think. Which means, at max, 26 total words) You must learn his language in order to find out what he wants, tell him what you want, and get each other what you guys need.

### Basics:
You can walk around, perform some basic functions (moving things around, and then other things that are probably level-specific), and talk to the alien. You can say whatever combination of words to him in his language, and he will respond in a way that makes sense.

### Design:
Very basic, like an 8-bit --> ![](https://github.com/sozalpasan1/The-Alien/blob/main/image1.png)

It’s a 2D game, and we have a Birds Eye view of you walking around. The floor is hexagons. The graphics are bad, and the user can just be a circle or something.

### Other Stuff:
We will hopefully make multiple levels. The language, along with what each of you need from each other, is completely different every time. But different levels aren’t necessarily harder. Keep in mind that I want to keep this realistic. It’s totally OK if the game is “too hard”. We can make it easier afterward, as long as we always stick to the fact that the alien is actually speaking in his language. It can be a very simple language (like I said, only like 20 words), but the rules must be consistent. Also, you can’t make gestures or face movements or anything to the alien. It’s an alien, so it won’t understand them. The human gesture for “hungry” could be the alien gesture for “I love vacuuming”. The human tone of voice meaning that you’re scared could be the alien tone of voice meaning that its tired.


### WORDS USED IN EVERY LEVEL:
I, You, No, Yes, One, Two, Many, question, want, be (just one word for am, is, was, are, etc), give



### WORDS SPECIFIC TO LEVEL 1:
Wolf, Help, Lock, Key, Rock, food



### PLOT FOR LEVEL 1:
You are on the other side of a fence from the alien. You can’t climb over (being able to physically interact with the alien would add too many new variables. Maybe for level 2 you’re like, watching the alien through cameras and can speak back and forth through the intercom and stuff?). Anyway, you need it to give you some of the food that is lying around on its side of the fence because you are very hungry. It needs you to look under a rock on your side of the fence to get a key, and then throw the key to the alien so he can unlock his chains and leave. There are wolves in the area and he wants to get out of there before they find him.



### NOTE:
he plot may change if it needs to. What’s important is simplicity and consistency.
